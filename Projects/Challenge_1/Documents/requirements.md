# Challenge 1
This is the first challenge of the course.

## Requirements
The Requirements are as so:
- Write a C program that displays your first name as output
    - Delete the "main.c" file that was auto-generated when creating the project
    - Create a new source file in the above project (name the file test.c)
    - Copy the source code into your test.c program
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("Hi, my name is ...");
    return 0;
}
```
## Next steps
1. Modify the source code to display your name (edit line stating with ```printf```).
2. Compile and link the source code.
3. Run the program.
4. Analyze the output to confirm it is correct and display your name.
